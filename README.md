Personalize `kaguyasays` by adding your favorite quotes.

The world is your oyster.
%%
This is a
multi-line quote. It works
perfectly!
%%
How cute.
```

## üí° Tips & Tricks

#### 1\. Greet Yourself on Terminal Startup

Have Kaguya-sama greet you every time you open a new terminal by adding `kaguyasays` to your shell's startup file.

  * **For Fish:** Add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

    ```fish
    # Add this to the end of the file
    if status is-interactive
        kaguyasays
    end
    ```

  * **For Bash:** Add to `~/.bashrc`

    ```bash
    # Add this to the end of the file
    kaguyasays
    ```

  * **For Zsh:** Add to `~/.zshrc`

    ```zsh
    # Add this to the end of the file
    kaguyasays
    ```

#### 2\. Create a Custom `clear` Command

Create an alias or function that clears the screen and then runs `kaguyasays`.

  * **For Fish:** Create a new function at `~/.config/fish/functions/cleark.fish`

    ```fish
    function cleark
        clear
        kaguyasays
    end
    ```

  * **For Bash/Zsh:** Add this function to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

    ```bash
    cleark() {
        clear
        kaguyasays
    }
    ```

Now, just run `cleark` for a fresh, Kaguya-blessed terminal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

  * **Required:**
      * `chafa`: A powerful terminal graphics utility used to display the image.
  * **Optional (but recommended for full experience):**
      * `fortune`: Provides a database of random adages and quotes.
      * `lolcat`: Adds a touch of rainbow color to the output.

The installation script will try to install these for you.
